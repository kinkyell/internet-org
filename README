In order to start development you should have cloned this theme into the wp-content/themes/vip/ directory of the VIP Quickstsart.

Here are the instructions for getting setup with the Quickstart:

Getting Started #
The first time you run the installer will be the slowest. This is because it has to download the virtual machine image, Ubuntu package updates, the full checkout of WordPress trunk, and the full VIP Plugins repository.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/Automattic/vip-quickstart.git
Set “10.86.73.80 vip.local” in your hosts file or configure Zeroconf
Change directory to the vip-quickstart directory: cd vip-quickstart
Run vagrant up
Go to http://vip.local in your browser, login with username: wordpress, password: wordpress

There is a secondary repo for plugins (repo url in mainframe). Checkout the repo as internet_org-plugins, this will ensure the plugins are found and loaded correctly (see theme functions.php file for inclusions). This is a requried structure by VIP, all custom functions must be included in the theme, however, having them in a separate directory (and ultimately, repo) they can be included using wpcom_vip_plugin_load instead of a require_once.
